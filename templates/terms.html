    <h4>Terms of use for the SweGen dataset (release 20161223)</h4>

    <!-- Apart from the links and markup, VERBATIM OF TERMS AND AGREEMENT
         IN THE FILE terms_of_use.txt IN TOP-LEVEL OF REPO -->

    <p>
        All data in the SweGen dataset are human allele frequencies estimated
        from aggregates across large sample groups, rendering contributing
        individuals non-identifiable.  The method used for estimating the
        frequencies is described in the corresponding publication.  Data is
        versioned and frequencies in different data versions may be different.
        No individual level genetic data is contained in this dataset.  We
        encourage the use and publication of frequency data for specific
        targeted sets of variants (for instance, assessing a set of candidate
        causal variants observed in a collection of rare disease patients).
    </p>
    <p>
        By accessing the data you agree to the following terms and conditions,
        irrespective of the method used to retrieve the data (for example vcf
        file download or variant query through Beacon or other methods):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You are allowed to freely search the data at the SweFreq website,
            and download any files containing allele frequency data made
            available on this site after registration.
        </li>
        <li>
            The data may not be used to attempt to identify any individual in
            this or other studies.
        </li>
        <li>
            No global analysis of the data may be published before the SweGen
            project's own upcoming publication, estimated early 2017.  A notice
            will appear on <a href="https://swefreq.nbis.se">https://swefreq.nbis.se</a> stating when new global
            analyses may be published.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any published study that includes processing of the data
            shall include the data version used, acknowledge the original
            study with the sentence "The SweGen allele frequency data was
            generated by Science for Life Laboratory", and cite the following
            publication: SweGen: A whole-genome map of genetic variability in
            a cross-section of the Swedish population.  Ameur et al., bioRxiv
            081505; (doi:10.1101/081505)
        </li>
        <li>
            The data may be redistributed in original or modified form, but must
            always be distributed together with the file "terms_of_use.txt"
            that is stored together with the data and available here
            [<a href="https://swefreq.nbis.se/#/downloadData/">https://swefreq.nbis.se/#/downloadData/</a>], and any redistributed
            data derived from the SweGen data set must follow those terms and
            conditions.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Disclaimer</h4>

    <p>
        This dataset is based on individuals from population-based
        cross-sectional studies.  No phenotype information has been used as
        inclusion criteria in the dataset.  Individuals with common diseases
        occur at the general population prevalence of the disease.  As a
        consequence, genetic variants contributing to disease risk occur in
        the dataset at the general population frequency.  There is no explicit
        or implicit guarantee that the genetic variants in the dataset do not
        contribute to risk of disease.
    </p>

    <h4>Citation in publications</h4>

        Any use of SweGen data should be cited by our preprint on bioRxiv
